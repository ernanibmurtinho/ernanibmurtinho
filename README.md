## 🚀 What I'm Building

**[Gecko Payments](https://geckovision.tech)** — Shopify for crypto, but without the wallet anxiety.

I'm building hosted checkout flows that feel like Stripe but settle in USDC on Solana. Think:
- **Embedded wallets** (email/social login, no seed phrases)
- **Gas abstraction** (sponsored transactions)
- **Merchant dashboard** (webhooks, payment links, analytics)

Target: high-ticket & high-risk ecommerce where traditional payments say no.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Most crypto checkout flows:
1. Ask users to "connect wallet"
2. Make them buy gas tokens
3. Hope they don't abandon

**We skip all that.** Pay with email. Receive USDC. Done.
