## 🚀 What I'm Building

**Gecko Vision** — *Agentic Growth Ops* for creators on **Farcaster**.

I’m building an AI-first tool that helps creators:
- **Generate Frames/Mini Apps** (interactive posts) from templates (no-code)
- **QA + Preview** before publishing (catch broken frames, bad configs, missing metadata)
- **Monitor performance in real-time** (views/likes/replies/recasts, CTR, conversions)
- **Auto-optimize campaigns** based on past posts + live metrics
- Run **gasless onchain actions** when it matters (AA + paymasters)

Think: *“Don’t let me waste a post”* + *“Make my campaigns smarter every day.”*

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Creators lose momentum (and revenue) when:
1. Frames break in production
2. Campaigns are posted with no QA or iteration loop
3. Analytics are fragmented and slow to act on
4. Onchain actions add friction (gas, wallets, UX anxiety)

**Gecko makes SocialFi workflows feel operational**:
- publish safely
- measure fast
- improve automatically
- keep UX smooth with gas sponsorship where needed

## 🧠 Core Product Modules

### 1) Frame Doctor (QA + Preview)
- Validate frame metadata, actions, params, deep links
- Simulate locked/unlocked flows
- Detect anti-farm gaps (one claim per FID, rate limits)
- Output: *preview report + fix suggestions + publish-ready version*

### 2) Campaign Autopilot (Monitor + Optimize)
- Track performance in real time
- Alert on anomalies (drop in engagement / conversion)
- Suggest next best actions (copy/CTA/time/template)
- Daily/weekly reports with learnings and recommended experiments

### 3) Onchain Actions (Base + USDC)
- Optional: USDC payments, claims, receipts (collectibles)
- AA + Paymaster for gasless first actions (conversion lever)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```ts
const stack = {
  social: ["Farcaster (Frames v2 / Mini Apps)", "Neynar", "OpenClaw"],
  chain: ["Base", "USDC", "Account Abstraction", "Paymasters"],
  backend: ["Next.js", "Node.js", "TypeScript"],
  data: ["Postgres/Supabase (or equivalent)", "Webhooks", "Event listeners"],
  infra: ["Vercel", "Queues/Cron for agents", "Observability/log replay"]
};
```

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- [ ] Frame Doctor v0 (QA + preview report + publish flow)
- [ ] Campaign monitoring + daily performance reports
- [ ] 2–3 templates (Pay-to-Reveal, Claim perk, Tip-to-mint)
- [ ] First pilot creators (educators/writers/dev creators → then gamers)
- [ ] Gasless claim (AA + Paymaster) with spend caps

## 🤝 Looking For

| Who | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Farcaster creators** | Run 1–2 campaigns as design partners |
| **Builders using Frames/Mini Apps** | Feedback on QA checks + best practices |
| **Base ecosystem / DevRel** | Demo partnerships + ecosystem alignment |
| **Growth operators / community managers** | Help define the “autopilot” workflows |

If you’re a creator who posts consistently on Farcaster and wants **less guesswork + fewer broken launches**, let’s talk.
